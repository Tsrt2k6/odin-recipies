        <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large boneless chicken breast or 2 smaller ones</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried rose mary or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh</li>
            <li>2 medium size red or white potatoes you won't have to peel red or white potatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 pound fresh asparagus spears</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set your oven at 400°F. On a dishwasher safe cutting board slice the boneless skinless chicken breast in half horizontally resulting in two thin filets. Cover them with plastic wrap and pound them to a more even thickness with the flat side of a meat mallet or a rolling pin or the bottom of a sauce pan.  Or, just go with chicken tenders.</li>
            <li>Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray or wipe it with olive oil. Lay the chicken filets in the pan and lightly sprinkle salt, pepper and dried rosemary onto both sides. You know,, after the salt and pepper you can get creative and spice up the filets any way that YOU want i.e. garlic powder, red pepper flakes, dried basil, paprika, cumin, turmeric and on and on. Tonight we just went with dried rosemary leaves and it worked out real good. Cut the stump ends off of the asparagus spears and then into about 2″ pieces. Cut the potatoes into small chunks and and spread them both around outside of the chicken. Drizzle with olive oil and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until the filets are firm to a poke or the liquid is running clear or the internal temperature is 165°F on an instant read meat thermometer.</li>
            <li>Move your One Pan Oven Baked Chicken Dinner to plates and enjoy your quick and easy meal.</li>
