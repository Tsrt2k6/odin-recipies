        <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>2 sticks of Butter softened</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of Sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>3 cups of Flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set your oven at 350F</li>
            <li>Blend together all of the ingredients except the flour.</li>
            <li>Then mix in the flour 1 cup at a time. Blending the flour in thoroughly  after each cup is added. Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Scoop the batter on to the tray with a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon in about half the size that you want your finished cookies to be. The cookies are going to flatten out some as they bake so donâ€™t crowd them too close together. Bake for 15-20 minutes until the bottoms are brown.</li>
