        <img width="50%" src="https://www.foodline.sg/PageImage/Caterer/719-Cafe/42258_large.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 of a 1 lb. box of spaghetti (or linguini or fettuccini)</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 -6 chicken tenders</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic sliced or chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or 1 and 1/2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a pot of salted water on for the pasta. Add the pasta right away. As the water heats up and the pasta softens, using a pair of tongs, get it all down into the water and stir it a few times with the tongs as it cooks to keep it from sticking together.

Put a skillet on at medium high. Add enough good extra virgin olive oil to coat bottom about 1/8″ deep. Cut the chicken into chunks or slices and add it to the skillet. Lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. Also red pepper flakes if you want it a little spicy. Cook it until it is browned and firm.</li>
            <li>While the chicken and the pasta are cooking slice or chop the garlic cloves and the parsley if you are using fresh parsley. But if you prefer, using dried parsley flakes works just fine.</li>
            <li>When the chicken is done push it out to the sides of the skillet and put the garlic in the center. You’re going to want enough olive oil to thoroughly coat the pasta when you put it in the skillet. So, if the bottom of the skillet is dry from cooking the chicken add some more extra virgin olive oil right on to the garlic.</li>
            <li>You don’t want the garlic to turn brown. So, let’s have it just light golden and translucent – 2-3 minutes.

If the pasta is done before the garlic just drain all but about a half cup of the water.  Put it on the back of the stove. Drizzle a little olive oil and stir it getting the pasta covered with the oil so that it doesn’t stick together.

As soon as the garlic is ready add the pasta to the skillet. Also, a little bit of the water that you left in the pot. Put in the grated parmesan and the parsley holding a little of the parmesan back for garnish.  Gently stir it all together.</li>
            <li>Your Spaghetti Aglio e Olio with Chicken is ready. Bon Appetito!!!</li>
